# Knowledge Sharing

This repository is intended to contain hands-on training content (and very little theory) for anyone and everyone who might be interested. 

Keeping in mind the repeated demand for the same training content again and again, but for a newer audience, I am creating this repository. Anyone is free to enhance the existing content and/or use the training material provided here for self-learning or to deliver sessions in open communities.
